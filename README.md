- Hi, Iâ€™m RadamÃ©s, Currently I am working with automated testing/unity testing/manual testing.
- My primary framework is Angular, but I know a lot of languages more, like: C++, Python, php, a litte bit of Java, Javascript, typescript, so forth and so on.
- I know a lot of Css3, html5 for web development, CRUD and API management.
- I also know a little bit of react native too for mobile developing. Currently Iâ€™m looking to only upload my ideas and nothing more.
- If you want to reach me send me an email: c.obvio@gmail.com
